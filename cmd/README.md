---

### WriteConfigToFile(string)

```go
WriteConfigToFile(string) error
```

WriteConfigToFile writes the configuration data to a YAML file at
the specified filepath. It uses the yaml.Marshal function to convert
the configuration struct into YAML format, and then writes the
resulting bytes to the file.

This function is a custom alternative to Viper's built-in WriteConfig method
to provide better control over the formatting of the output YAML file.

**Parameters:**
filepath: The path of the file where the configuration
data will be saved.

**Returns:**

error: An error if any issues occur during the marshaling or file
writing process, otherwise nil.
