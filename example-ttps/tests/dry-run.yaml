name: Test Case with Dry Run
description: |
  This TTP illustrates the impact of the `dry_run` field
  on the behavior of a test case. When `dry_run` is set
  to `true`, the `--dry-run` flag will be appended
  to the `ttpforge run` command that is constructed to execute
  the test case. This means that the TTP will be validated
  (after full template rendering) but not executed.
tests:
  - name: default
    dry_run: true
    # note that we still need to specify
    # a valid set of arguments!
    args:
      file_suffix: wut
args:
  - name: file_suffix
    description: the suffix to append to the created file
steps:
  # this contrived TTP would only work on a very specific system
  # for which this path exists. We still want the validate
  # that THIS YAML FILE ITSELF is a valid TTP that COULD
  # run under the right conditions, so we specify `dry_run: true`
  # in the test case.
