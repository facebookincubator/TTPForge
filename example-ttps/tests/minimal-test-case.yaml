description: |
  This TTP illustrates the simplest possible valid test case
  within its `tests:` section. When the tests for
  this TTP are executed using the `ttpforge test` command,
  the single test case `default` will be executed. This will
  cause `ttpforge run` to be executed against this TTP
  YAML file and the resulting exit status will be checked.
tests:
  - name: default
steps:
  - name: placeholder-step
    print_str: "I am a placeholder to show off the `tests:` feature."
