name: Path Argument Demo
description: |
  This TTP demonstrates how path arguments with default values work.
  The default path is relative to the YAML file's directory, NOT the
  directory where ttpforge was executed.

  Example Usage:
    # Create a test file in the same directory as this YAML
    echo "Hello from YAML directory" > example-ttps/args/test-file.txt

    # Run with default (will read the file relative to YAML location)
    ttpforge run example-ttps/args/path-default-relative.yaml

    # Or override with your own file (relative to where you run ttpforge)
    echo "Hello from execution directory" > my-file.txt
    ttpforge run example-ttps/args/path-default-relative.yaml --arg file_path=my-file.txt

args:
  - name: new_dir
    type: path
    description: Path to change directory to
    default: $HOME
  - name: file_path
    type: path
    description: Path to a file to read
    default: ./test-file.txt
