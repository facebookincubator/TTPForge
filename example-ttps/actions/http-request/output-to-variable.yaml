  This TTP shows you how to use the http request action type to send a GET request to a url and store the response in a variable for
  use in later steps.  Additionally, this TTP shows you how to use the regex action type to extract a portion of the response.
steps:
  - name: Basic GET Request
    http_request: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookincubator/TTPForge/refs/heads/main/README.md
    type: GET
    regex: "## Installation([^\n]*\n){10}"
    outputvar: facebook_html
    cleanup:
      inline: |
        echo "No cleanup required."
  - name: Use variable
    inline: |
      echo 'The html returned from the GET request is: {[{.StepVars.facebook_html}]}'
