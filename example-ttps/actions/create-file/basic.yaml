  This TTP shows you how to use the create_file action type
  to create files on disk
steps:
  - name: create-first-tmp-file
    create_file: /tmp/ttpforge_create_file_{{randAlphaNum 10}}
    contents: |
      Using create_file is a convenient to simulate TTPs that
      drop files to disk. We can control the permission mode
      with which the file is created using `mode:`
    mode: 0600
    cleanup: default
  - name:  create-second-tmp-file
    create_file: /tmp/ttpforge_create_file_overwritable
    contents: |
      This step uses `overwrite: true` which means
      that even if the target file already exists, it will be overwritten with these
      contents
    overwrite: true
    cleanup: default
